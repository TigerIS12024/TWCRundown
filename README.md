This repository focuses on The Weather Channels rundown used from November 2013 to August 2019, also known as EZScroll. This is a tool which allows you to create rundowns and scrolls and tickers.
I haven't made any snapshots of this yet, but I have to connect a VPN to Australia and snap shot it, and download the files. If I caught a snapshot, I will post it.
